Split across two files; some code repetition

Despite the parsing files being pretty similar, they're pattern matches differently, so it wouldn't be exactly the same in both parts

I also enjoy the fact that each file is just the Main funtion which handles I/O, and the pipeline, and the function which parses and solves each line
